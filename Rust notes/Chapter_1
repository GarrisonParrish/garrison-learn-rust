Getting Started

Cargo has different commands to debug. compile, and test code

cargo build will make an executable (binary) file at target/debug
to execute this file, write ./target/debug/filename

cargo run will both compile and execute (same process)--if nothing has changed, simply execute the binary again

cargo check will quickly check to see if the code compiles, but does not create and executable

As Cargo projects get bigger, these commands will probably become more useful
	-> ability to quickly check if a project will compile, without performing a write to disk, is a powerful tool

Similar process to C (compiled and then run, binaries can be executed on different systems)

Cargo.toml (uses TOML config file format, very nice) contains info about dependencies, versions (similar to pom.xml in Maven projects)

Use 'cargo check' to check your code, 'cargo build' when you're ready to run it

Use cargo build --release to compile with optimizations (takes longer to compile)
	-> makes executable in target/release
